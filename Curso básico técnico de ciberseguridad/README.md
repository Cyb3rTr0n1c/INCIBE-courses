## üë®‚Äçüíª About This Repository  
Welcome to my INCIBE Cybersecurity Repository! This repository contains all the projects, activities, and materials I have completed as part of the Basic Technical Cybersecurity Course from INCIBE. The course covers foundational cybersecurity concepts across three introductory transversal topics and delves into four specialized areas:  

- **ASC**: Administraci√≥n de Sistemas Inform√°ticos (System Administration)  
- **ICI**: Seguridad Industrial (Industrial Security)  
- **AIF**: Gesti√≥n de Incidentes y An√°lisis Forense (Incident Management and Forensic Analysis)  
- **CeC**: Compliance, Cumplimiento Legal (Compliance and Legal Requirements)  

Each section showcases my understanding and practical skills in these critical cybersecurity domains.
